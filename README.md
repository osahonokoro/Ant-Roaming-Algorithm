# Ant-Roaming-Algorithm
Ant Roaming Algorithm (ARA), a biologically inspired approach to optimizing adaptive security patrols in resource-constrained environments. Drawing inspiration from ant colony optimization, ARA formalizes pheromone dynamics, probabilistic routing, and adaptive updates to guide patrol agents.
